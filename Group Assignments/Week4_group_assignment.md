# Week 4: Mini Group Assignment
by Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen and Claire Guo

## Project Title: Global Music Trends

Read our project proposal [here]().

## Roles

## Status Update

## Data Update
From our three original data sets, we have joined the genres data to both the May 2020 and the 2017-2019 Spotify data sets. The 2017-2019 spotify data set we initially had contained over 8 million observations. Thus, we had to cut down the data set significantly in order to work with it in Jupyter Notebook. To do this, we subsetted the data to only include observations from June 2019. With this reduced data, we could then conduct an inner join with the genres data set to create a data set with around 300,000 observations (spotify_june2019.csv). We did the same join with the genres data and the May 2020 data, which was already small enough to work with (spotify_may2020.csv). Presently, we are doing explorations on both data sets with the goal to eventually choose just one.

Furthermore, we are also exploring global census data, specifically looking at profiles regarding economic and political differences. In the coming weeks, we plan to use our new joined data in conjunction with the census data to analyze how global music trends are potentially affected through economic and political discourse. 

## Concerns:
### Major Concerns

### Minor Concerns

Roles (only for groups): Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."
Status update: Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
Data update: Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.
Concerns: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."
