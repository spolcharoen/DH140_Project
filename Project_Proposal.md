# DH140 Project Proposal
by Claire Guo and Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

## Introduction
Spotify is an audio streaming platform that is used by millions of artists and listeners across the globe. In our DH140 project, we want to analyze top songs in different countries and what makes them popular. After careful analysis, we hope to answer the following question:

### Research Question: What are the characteristics of top songs across the world and why?
An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
* Help Spotify AI Mission/Spotify Advertising -- so that they know what type of music to recommend in each country
 
 * “Our mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity – by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it.”
 
* Artists Advertising -- help artists learn what music to create to cater to certain regions


A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project

* Global charts - select countries in 6 continents 

* 2017 - 2019

* Space matters to compare between countries and how different cultures are expressed through music taste. Time matters to see how music in different countries change over time.

As music streaming and advertising has shifted to a mainly online format, data and trends become available for us to analyze. With our project, we want to provide information that Spotify and music artists can use to best market their content. Different countries have their own cultures, influences, and popular media. Thus, music taste can vary greatly between different regions. Thus, we want to analyze what makes certain songs popular in certain countries, so that creators can learn what their audience is, as well as how to cater towards them. Furthermore, we want to support Spotify in their mission statement:

> “Our mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity – by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it.”

The spatial scope for this project is global. The data sources we chose cover a variety of countries across the world. Working through a global lens is important for this project because we want to see how different cultures between countries are expressed through music taste. Moreover, with data ranging from 2017 to 2019, we will be able to gain a wide understanding of music trends over time, as well as across nations. 


## Data Sources

The first dataset contains Spotify’s top songs by country in May 2020. The dataset contains the title, rank, artists, album, duration, country and continent of the top 50 songs by country.

The second dataset is an analysis of song characteristics, such as speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, and liveness, for different kinds of music genres.

The third dataset contains Spotify’s top 200 songs in each country from 2017 - July 1st, 2019. The data contains the country, date, track, position, track name, artist, and number of streams for each top song.

In our project, we intend on combining datasets listing top songs in each country with datasets that measure song characteristics by genre in order to find what kinds of characteristics make songs popular in each country. We hope to combine this data to create a visual map showing what kinds of songs are popular in each country and then create bar charts for specific countries that break down popular song preferences by their song characteristics.

## Conclusion

From this research, we hope to better understand how the world listens to music and how music tastes differ due to location and culture. We intend on using Spotify datasets to visualize cultural differences between countries and hope to discover what specific characteristics in songs make them popular in specific countries. This data can be used by artists in around the world to create favorable music for their targeted listeners and help Spotify recommend music to listeners in different countries that they will most likely enjoy.
