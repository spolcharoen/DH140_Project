by Claire Guo and Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

## Introduction
An introduction of your research question

### Research Question:
An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
* Help Spotify AI Mission/Spotify Advertising -- so that they know what type of music to recommend in each country
 
 * “Our mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity – by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it.”

A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project

* Global charts - select countries in 6 continents
